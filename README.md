# Comparing-Unemployment-And-Education

The purpose behind this website is to create a more interactive approach to show in a visual way how education can end up affecting something such
as being unemployed. It is my hope that for those that take a look a the charts and representative map that we can help educate and bring about a
better understanding of how important higher education is for the future of individuals.

  *Some things to note about interacting with the map*
  
    How to use the chart graphics:
      1) Understand: The charts below are designed to help reflect and understand how education can affect unemployment
      rates within counties.
      
      2) Main Chart: Since the purpose of these charts is too compare  unemployment to education it is recommend to 
      first start by selecting the desired unemployment range.
      
      3) Selecting Ranges: In order to select ranges hover your cursor over the desired chart until a crosshair pointer
      appear. Then click on the percentage you wish to start measuring from, drag the crosshair to the desired percentage,
      and release. The chart will select that percentage range.
      
      4) Reseting: If at any point you desire to reset the graphs a blue "reset" button will appear next to the graphs near 
      their titles. Simply click on it and the entire chart and map will go back to its original display.
      
      5) Final Notes: After you select your desired unemployment rate the rest of the charts below it will reflect that 
      change. If you desire to change the percentage rates being selected on the other charts simply follow the same 
      procedure as noted above.
